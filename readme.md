## Field Trip Project üìö

### Project Summary üìù

This project is an interactive website dedicated to showcasing the Bandolier Bag artifact at the Eiteljorg Museum. The Bandolier Bag is a stunning example of Indigenous artistry, often created with vibrant colors, intricate beadwork, and rich cultural symbolism. These bags were not just decorative, but also held ceremonial and social significance.

I chose this artifact because of its blend of history, craftsmanship, and storytelling ‚Äî it‚Äôs a powerful way to connect users to Indigenous cultures through a digital, interactive experience. My goal was to create a site that feels visually dynamic while also educating users through engaging features like scroll animations, interactive image hovers, and a timeline.

### Design Choices üé®

- **Styling Inspiration**  
  - Inspired by museum websites and Indigenous digital archives. Referenced sites like the [Eiteljorg Museum](https://eiteljorg.org/).

- **Color Palette**

  - **Gradient Black-to-Gray:** Used for dramatic hero backgrounds and to create visual depth.

- **Typography**  
  - Used clear, legible fonts to make historical information accessible and educational. Headers use bold serif styles for a historical tone, while body text remains clean and modern.

  - Images are stored in an `assets/images` folder.  
  - Web pages are structured using semantic HTML5.  
  - Timeline events are wrapped in divs with `.reveal` classes for scroll-triggered animations.  
  - JavaScript observes elements using the Intersection Observer API to apply the active/inactive states dynamically.
