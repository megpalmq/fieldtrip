            Indigenous communities in the Great Lakes and Prairie regions used
            shoulder bags crafted from natural materials like plant fibers and
            animal hides. These early forms were used for daily utility and
            ceremonial purposes, without European influence.

            Bandolier bags began incorporating European trade goods like wool,
            glass beads, and cotton fabric. The designs became more colorful and
            geometric, influenced by both Indigenous patterns and Western trade
            aesthetics.

            Beadwork flourished during this time. Bags were often worn during
            public gatherings and dances. Patterns were deeply symbolic,
            representing clan identity, spiritual beliefs, and community
            heritage.

            Bandolier bags became important markers of cultural pride and
            resistance. As assimilation policies increased in the U.S. and
            Canada, Indigenous artists continued to create and wear these bags
            in defiance of cultural erasure.

            Many artifacts were collected by museums and institutions, often
            without the consent of Native communities. While fewer bags were
            made during this time, their significance as cultural memory objects
            remained strong.

            Contemporary Indigenous artists continue the tradition, blending
            ancestral techniques with modern materials. Bandolier bags are
            celebrated as expressions of identity, history, and cultural
            resilience.
